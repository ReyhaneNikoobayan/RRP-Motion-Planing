# RRP Motion Planing

The first task is to design the motion trajectory of a 3-DOF spherical robot from a given initial position to a final position in Cartesian space.

- Initial position (mm): (Xi​,Yi​,Zi​)=(284.829,−164.446,190.293)

- final position (mm):   (Xf​,Yf​,Zf​)=(91.203,340.373,605.682)

The movement must be completed in 1 second, with the following conditions:

- **The path type itself is not important, but the motion of the joints must be smooth.**

- **A polynomial trajectory (multi-term interpolation) should be used to ensure continuity of position, velocity, and acceleration throughout the motion.**
