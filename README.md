# RRP Motion Planing

## The first task is to design the motion trajectory of a 3-DOF spherical robot from a given initial position to a final position in Cartesian space.

- Initial position (mm): (Xi​,Yi​,Zi​)=(284.829,−164.446,190.293)

- final position (mm):   (Xf​,Yf​,Zf​)=(91.203,340.373,605.682)

The movement must be completed in 1 second, with the following conditions:

- **The path type itself is not important, but the motion of the joints must be smooth.**

- **A polynomial trajectory (multi-term interpolation) should be used to ensure continuity of position, velocity, and acceleration throughout the motion.**

**Joints equation base on conditions:**

Theta1=-30+315*t^2-210*t 

Theta2=-20+180*t^2-120*t^3  

D=50+330*t^2-220*t^3

## The second task is to design a trajectory motion from a given initial position to a final position but with these conditions:

-**The robot’s end-effector must move along a straight line from the initial position to the final position.**

-**The trajectory is designed based on a trapezoidal velocity profile with the following limits:**

                          vmax​=30cm/s ​,amax​=±4g​
                          
We first calculate end-effector position base on velocity, Then we transfer end effector position to joint state.
